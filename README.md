### SixLetterWordExercise

There's a file in the root of the repository, input.txt, that contains words of varying lengths (1 to 6 characters).

Objective is to show all combinations of those words that together form a word of 6 characters. That combination must also be present in input.txt
E.g.:

_foobar_  
_fo_
_obar_
should result in the ouput:

**fo+obar=foobar**
